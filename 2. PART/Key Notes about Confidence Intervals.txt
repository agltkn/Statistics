Key Notes about Confidence Intervals

ğŸ’¡A point estimate is a single number.

ğŸ’¡A confidence interval, naturally, is an interval.

ğŸ’¡Confidence intervals are the typical way to present estimates as an interval range.

ğŸ’¡The point estimate is located exactly in the middle of the confidence interval.

ğŸ’¡However, confidence intervals provide much more information and are preferred when making inferences.

ğŸ’¡The more data you have, the less variable a sample estimate will be.

ğŸ’¡The lower the level of confidence you can tolerate, the narrower the confidence interval will be.
